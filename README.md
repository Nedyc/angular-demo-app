# Angular Demo App
This is a demo app I've made to practice with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS).
The app is pretty simple, it's only a list of books with authors and the possibility to add them dinamically.

# Installation
First of all, clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Nedyc/angular-demo-app.git angular-demo-app

## Backend
- access to the "backend" directory
- type "npm update" in order to install all the node library dependencies
- Create a mongo database (if a first collection is required just add 'authors'
- edit the db.js file's string: 'mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.8abbx.mongodb.net/dbName?retryWrites=true&w=majority' with your db connection one
- run "node index.js"

## Frontend
- access to the "frontendd" directory
- type "npm update" in order to install all the node library dependencies
- run "ng serve --open"

Have Fun!
